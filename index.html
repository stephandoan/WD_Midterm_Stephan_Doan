      <b>Care for Your Rabbits, Please</b>
    </div>

    <p class="tab">
      So you're probably here because you're looking for or already
      have a rabbit. A lot of people or articles might have told
      you that they're simple, cheap pets to take care of, but
      that couldn't be further from the truth. If that's not the case,
      I have some other advice and tips for taking care of your rabbit(s).
      Either way, hopefully I can answer any questions or clear up any
      misunderstandings you might have. I will point out that this site
      is a collection of information I found through researching online and
      from talking with rabbit owners, and will occasionally be subjective.

      <b>Misconceptions</b>
    </div>

    <p class="tab">
      There's plenty of myths that go around about pet rabbits
      and their care. A lot of it stems from rabbit farming or
      uninformed parents passing on their knowledge. Here are the
      most common myths that I see getting passed around.
    </p>
    <p class="list">
      <b><i>Rabbits are easy pets to care for.</i></b>  No. Sure, rabbits are
      fairly small and clean their own fur, but that's where the ease ends.
      Rabbits need a decent amount of space to move around in order to
      properly exercise or simply live comfortably. They should have a very
      strict diet due to their sensitive digestive system, and their bodies
      are very fragile. It's so easy to injure a rabbit that generally young
      children should not be around rabbits without extremely close
      supervision. They also need regular, thorough cleanings of their
      living areas, which leads into the next myth.
    </p>

      </div>
    </div>

    <p class="list">
      <b><i>Rabbits smell bad.</i></b>  They should only stink if you don't
      clean their litterbox or living space. If they still smell no matter
      how well you clean their space, they might have a health issue and you
      should probably take them to a vet as soon as you can.
    </p>
    <p class="list">
      <b><i>Rabbits can be released into the wild.</i></b>  Domestic rabbits
      do not know how to survive outside. They won't be able to find food on
      their own and will most likely starve to death or get eaten by a
      predator. Releasing a pet rabbit into the wild is essentially giving it
      a death sentence.
    </p>
    <p class="list">
      <b><i>Carrots are good for rabbits.</i></b>  Rabbits can eat carrots,
      but not as a primary food. Carrots contain too much sugar to be given
      to a rabbit regularly. However, carrots can be offered as an
      occasional treat.
    </p>
    <p class="list">
      <b><i>Rabbits can be kept outside.</i></b> This is not necessarily wrong,
      but many people keep their rabbits outside in uncomfortable or unsafe
      conditions. Rabbits left outside without a place to hide in like a
      small box or hut will become stressed from being in the open. They're
      also often left in pens that are too small for them, or pens with
      wire flooring that chafes their paws and hocks.
    </p>
    <p class="list">
      <b><i>Rabbits only live for 1-5 years.</i></b> When given proper care,
      rabbits generally live for 8-10 years, with some living a few years
      past that too. I believe this misconception comes from the many
      rabbits bought around Easter that die early because their owners
      weren't prepared to care for them.
    </p>

    <div class="subtitle">
      <b>Proper Living Conditions</b>
    </div>

    <p class="tab">
      Now let's get into what kind of a home you should be providing for your
      rabbit. Generally, the setup I see most often is free roam, where the
      rabbit can wander around most, if not all, of the home. This provides
      enough space for a rabbit to be comfortable, and is also an enriching
      environment for a rabbit to explore. There should also be rugs, towels,
      or some other material on the floor that rabbits can get a lot of
      traction on. They can feel extremely uncomfortable if they constantly
      have to move on a slippery material.
    </p>

    <div class="imgCon">
      <IMG SRC="rabbitPen.png" class="imgMargin" ALIGN="right" width="360px" HSPACE="50"  VSPACE="50">
      <div class="imgText">
        <div class="caption">A well maintained pen</div>
      </div>
    </div>

    <p class="tab">
      The next most ideal option is an indoor pen or separate room for the
      rabbit. Most rabbit hutches you can find online are actually too small
      for most rabbits to be comfortable in. The most basic size
      recommendation is about 4ft X 4ft of floor space and enough room for
      your rabbit to stand up in. However, you definitely need more space than
      that for your rabbit to be happy. They like to run around a lot, and
      need enough room to be able to hop around at full speed without
      hitting a wall.
    </p>

    <p class="tab">
      Once you have a space, you'll need a few other things. The most
      important additions are a water bottle and/or bowl, a box of hay,
      and a litterbox or similar container. The box of hay is usually
      kept near the litterbox since rabbits like to poop and pee near
      where they eat. Your rabbits should never go without hay;
      if they don't get enough hay, your rabbit can run into various
      digestive issues. They might also start chewing on things that
      they shouldn't be biting, such as wood, furniture, their litterbox,
      or whatever else they can get their teeth on. As for the water, some
      rabbits prefer drinking from bowls, others prefer a hamster bottle.
      My own rabbits use both, and run back and forth between the two. A
      water bowl should have a heavy bottom so that it can't be flipped
      over. Rabbits enjoy rearranging their living area, and can end up
      spilling water if the bowl isn't secure.
    </p>

    <p class="tab">
      You'll also need a comfortable place for your rabbits to hide in.
      They can get stressed out if they don't have some sort of den or hut.
      You can use small animal bedding in there to help keep it clean and
      comfortable. However, there is a correlation between the use of pine
      bedding and a higher risk of a rabbit not waking up from anaesthesia
      so it might be safer to avoid using that type of bedding.
    </p>

    <p class="tab">
      You should also provide your rabbit with a few more things for their
      enrichment. Dried/baked applewood sticks are good chew toys for them
      and are also light enough to be thrown around, something rabbits
      enjoy doing. Woven wooden balls and clean cardboard paper towel or
      toilet paper rolls can also serve the same purpose. Avoid toys made
      out of dried willow branches. These might splinter in your rabbit's
      stomach and injure them.
    </p>

    <p class="tab">
      I'm sure I don't need to tell you to clean your home if you let your
      rabbit free roam, but remember to spot clean your rabbit's enclosure
      whenever you can if they aren't free roam, and do a full clean at
      least once a week. If you don't let your rabbit free roam, make
      sure you give them at least one hour of supervised exercise per day,
      especially if their enclosure is on the smaller side.
    </p>

    <p class="tab">
      One of the last important things that your rabbit needs in order to
      thrive is a companion. Ideally you can try to find another rabbit and
      bond them with each other. If this isn't an option, you should try to
      spend a lot of time with your rabbit as well as let it free roam when
      possible. Rabbits generally live longer when they can socialize.
      Trying to bond an animal of a different species with a rabbit can be
      dangerous for either animal, and while it is possible, it is not
      recommended unless you are experienced with this kind of thing.
    </p>

    <div class="subtitle">
      <b>Good Dieting</b>
    </div>

    <p class="tab">
      To start, a baby rabbit should remain with its mother for two months
      after birth. Their chances for survival drop drastically when they
      are separated too early. After they stop drinking milk, a baby rabbit,
      or a kit, should be given alfalfa hay and alfalfa pellets for the next
      5-6 months, until they are about 8 months old. It's a good idea to mix
      in some timothy or other grass based hay into the alfalfa hay to make
      the transition to the grass hay later easier. Do <i>not</i> give your
      young rabbit too many pellets, or else they might have issues
      transitioning to their adult diet (which is mostly hay). You may also
      feed your rabbit some vegetables, but this is conditional. If you
      got your rabbit from a breeder, you can ask them what vegetable the
      mother was eating while feeding her kits. Small quantities of those
      vegetables will be fine to give to your rabbit as they grow up. If you
      can't get this information, it is safer to hold off on the vegetables
      until they're about 6-8 months old. Feeding them unfamiliar vegetables
      too early might give them digestive issues. Do not give them fruit
      until a month or two after giving them vegetables. As your rabbit
      grows, start reducing the amount of pellets at about 4 months old
      until you start offering half the original amount at around 6-8 months.
      If you have a giant breed of rabbit, add a month to each time here.
      Giant breeds mature slower than other breeds.

    <p class="tab">
      A rabbit's adult diet should be around 90% grass hay, usually timothy.
      Alfalfa hay has too much calcium and protein and can cause obesity if
      it is given to an adult rabbit. You can also use timothy based pellets
      instead of the alfalfa pellets, which would let you increase the amount
      of pellets you can give your rabbits. You should also feed your rabbit
      about 1 cup or about 2 ounces of vegetables per day (mostly dark leafy
      greens), either in one feeding or over multiple (the latter is
      recommended). Here are two lists of safe produce to feed to a rabbit,
      followed by a list of unsafe/toxic produce:
    </p>

    <p class="list">
      <b><i>Safe Produce:</i></b> Arugula, Carrot tops, Cucumber leaves,
      Endive, Ecarole, Frisee Lettuce, Kale (all types), Mache, Red or green
      lettuce, Romaine lettuce, Spring greens, Turnip greens, Dandelion
      greens, Mint, Basil, Watercress, Wheatgrass, Chicory, Raspberry leaves,
      Cilantro, Radicchio, Bok Choy, Fennel (top and base), Borage leaves,
      Dill leaves, and Yu choy
    </p>

    <p class="list">
      <b><i>Safe Produce (but use sparingly):</i></b> Parsley, Spinach,
      Beet Greens, Chard, and Radish tops
    </p>

    <p class="list">
      <b><i>Toxic Produce:</i></b> Iceberg lettuce, Garlic, Onion, Potato,
      Avocado, some Beans, and most Mushrooms.
    </p>

    <p class="list">
      If you have something that's not on any of those lists, either assume
      it isn't safe, or try searching else where for more information.
      Better safe than sorry.
    </p>

    <div class="subtitle">
      <b>Rabbit Talk</b>
    </div>

    <p class="tab">
      Now we can move onto some lighter content: the way rabbits communicate.
      Because rabbits don't make many noises unless they're upset or in
      distress, it can be hard to tell what's going on with them if you don't
      know what to look for. Here's a basic list of some of their usual gestures.
    </p>

    <p class="list">
      <b><i>Greeting/Sniffing: </i></b> Between rabbits, they usually touch noses. If
      you greet your rabbit, let them smell your finger or foot. Try not to
      walk past your rabbit without greeting them like that. Some of them
      can get upset that they're being ignored.
    </p>

    <p class="list">
      <b><i>Back turned/Kicking as they move/Snorting/Stomping:</i></b> If your
      rabbit is doing any of these things, they're probably upset with you.
      You might be invading their personal space, smell bad, or maybe you were
      slightly late with their food. If you can't figure out what's making
      them upset, a treat like a raisin might calm them down. When their back
      is turned to you, they might occasionally look back to see if you're
      paying attention to them. When they kick while hopping away, they're
      trying to kick dirt or poop onto you by instinct, even if there isn't
      any of that around. It'll be easy to tell when they're snorting and
      stomping.
    </p>

      <div class="imgCon">

        <div class="imgText">
          <div class="caption">A flopped rabbit</div>
        </div>
      </div>


    <p class="list">
      <b><i>Binkying:</i></b> When your rabbit starts zooming around the room,
      hopping along the walls or just in a small circle, it's called binkying.
      It usually means they're excited or happy about something. Hopefully you
      can see that a lot when you take care of your rabbit.
    </p>

    <p class="list">
      <b><i>Honking:</i></b> This can be confusing, because it's similar to
      snorting. If you are petting your rabbit or maybe holding them if
      they let you, they might honk if they feel content.
    </p>

    <p class="list">
      <b><i>Teeth Purring:</i></b> This means different things based on the
      context. If you are petting your rabbit or they're flopped, it's a good
      sound. On the other hand, if they're sitting up with their feet tucked
      close together and you can hear their teeth grinding while they sit
      still, they might be in pain. It's a sign that you might need to make
      a trip to the vet.
    </p>

    <p class="list">
      <b><i>Flop:</i></b> If you're not ready for this, you might be scared
      the first time you see it. When a rabbit flops, that means it's
      extremely comfortable and is a very good sign. However, when your rabbit
      does it, it might look like they just died. Flopping is when they drop
      onto their back or side, usually falling asleep or relaxing.
    </p>

        <div class="imgCon">

            <div class="caption">A rabbit asking another for grooming</div>
          </div>
        </div>

    <p class="list">
      <b><i>Eyes Wide/Squinting:</i></b> If your rabbit's eyes are wide open,
      they're fairly alert and might have heard something they're curious
      about. This is usually what they look like. If your rabbit is squinting,
      it means they're comfortable and relaxed at the moment. They may also be
      sleeping, because they sometimes sleep with their eyes open.
    </p>

    <p class="list">
      <b><i>Licking/Grooming/Head down:</i></b> If you are trying to bond
      two rabbits, you can tell it's starting to work when they start to
      groom themselves in front of each other. Eventually, they might be
      grooming each other. That is usually started by one of them laying
      their head down on the floor, which is actually a dominant position
      for rabbits. A feisty rabbit might bite you if you put your hand under
      their face. If a rabbit does that in front of you, it might be asking
      for you to pet it. Eventually, one of the rabbits will cave and start
      to groom the other.
    </p>

    <p class="list">
      <b><i>Periscoping:</i></b> When your rabbit hears or smells something
      out of the ordinary, they might pop up on two feet and try to locate
      whatever they just sensed. It isn't necessarily a fearful action. This
      is one of the reasons it's important to have room for your rabbit to
      stand up in its living space.
    </p>

    <div class="subtitle">
      <b>Rabbit Health</b>
    </div>

    <p class="tab">
      There's a few important things you have to do to keep your rabbit
      healthy. First is to make sure you get it to the vet and checked out.
      Vaccinate it and then spay/neuter as soon as possible. This is usually
      held off until the rabbit is bigger so that it is easier to perform
      the operation. It's important to do this because unspayed/unneutered
      rabbits are more aggressive and territorial because of the hormones
      they get. Female rabbits are often at a high risk of cancer if they
      remain unspayed as well.
    </p>

    <p class="tab">
      It's also fairly simple to check on your rabbit's digestive health.
      One of the easiest is looking for "golden" poops. They'll be lighter
      and more yellow in color. They should also always be dry. This means
      that your rabbit is eating the correct amount of hay. If their poop
      is too dark, try giving them less pellets for a while. If they start
      to have diarrhea, make sure you're giving them enough hay. They should
      always have access to some hay. Another couple of signs that
      something could be wrong with their diet are in their urine. If you
      see something red in the urine, check to see if it's blood by pouring
      hydrogen peroxide on it. If it foams, it's blood, and you should take
      your rabbit to the vet. Rabbit urine often comes out orange, brown,
      or red, so it's good to check sometimes. The other thing to look out
      for is bladder sludge, which is excess calcium that gets excreted.
      The urine will seem thick and cloudy, and if it dries, it leaves a
      white-ish crust. If you see this, you should reduce the amount of
      calcium-rich vegetables you give your rabbits, like kale. If you are
      feeding them alfalfa pellets, you can also reduce how much of that
      you give your rabbit.
